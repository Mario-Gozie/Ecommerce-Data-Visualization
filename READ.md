This is a Project on Ecommerce dataset. The dataset came in to forms, an excel sheet containing transaction details and a csv file containing geographical detail (logitudes and latitudes). The Geographical data is what will let me create maps seemlessly.

## TOOL USED

* SQL
* TABLEAU

## BRIEF SUMMARY OF STEPS APPLIED

  I used **Sql** query to join the two tables (The Transaction table and the Geographical Data) however since Tableau has **Relationship** feature tha can join data from different data source, I used it to join the transaction detail (Excel file) and the Geographical data (CSV file)
